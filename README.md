# Recursion Tree

A simple use-case and demonstration of recursion - drawing a tree.
I've desided to call it The Vegan Tree, don't know why, but veganism rock soooo, why not!

### TODO?
* Would be cool to rewrite into branches that grow longer while shrinking in thickness at the same time.
* That has a variability/randomness to branch - direction, growth & splits.
* With a stregth uppwards setting, how much the tree should reach for the sky.
* Then extend to 3 dimensions.
* ...Prevent the tree from growing into it self? ðŸ¤¯

Bye bye..

* Oh, the tree should of course grow over time!
